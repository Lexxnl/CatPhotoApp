# CatPhotoApp

This is a simple webpage about cats that I created while learning web development. It was part of a course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to practice HTML basics.

## What I Learned
By writing the code for this project, I learned:
- How to structure a webpage using HTML.
- How to use headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
- How to create ordered and unordered lists.
- How to create forms with input fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
- How to use semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`.

## Why Learning This Is Helpful
Learning these HTML basics is important for becoming a web developer because:
1. HTML is the foundation of all websites and web applications.
2. Employers look for a strong understanding of web development fundamentals.
3. It builds skills you will use every day as a developer.
4. It's the first step toward learning more advanced technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

## Acknowledgment
I didn't write all of this code on my own. This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp course, which provided guidance and instructions. I added my own effort by following the course and learning how everything works.
